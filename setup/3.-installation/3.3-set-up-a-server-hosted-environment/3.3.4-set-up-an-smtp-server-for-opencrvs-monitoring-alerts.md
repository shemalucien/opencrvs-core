# 3.7.4 Set up an SMTP server for OpenCRVS monitoring alerts

We use [Elastalert](https://elastalert.readthedocs.io/en/latest/), in tandem with ElasticSearch and Kibana to monitor the health of the OpenCRVS stack in production.&#x20;

In order for OpenCRVS to alert your Technical System Administrator of any memory or hardware issues, we have set up email notifications as the Elastalert option. Therefore you must have an [SMTP service](https://www.wpbeginner.com/showcase/best-smtp-service-providers-with-high-email-deliverability/) setup.  You can read more about monitoring OpenCRVS here.

[Google offers SMTP services for free](https://kinsta.com/blog/gmail-smtp-server/) linked to a Gmail account, but there are countless other paid for SMTP services such as [Mailchimp](https://mailchimp.com/).&#x20;



1\.  You will need to take note of your **SMTP host, port, username,** **password** & your **Technical System Administrator's email address** for the next step. We have hardcoded the service to use SMTP **SSL by default**.
