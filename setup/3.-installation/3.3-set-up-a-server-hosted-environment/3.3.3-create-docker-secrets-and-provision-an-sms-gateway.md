# 3.3.3 Create Docker Secrets & provision a comms gateway

### Create Docker Secrets for OpenHIM

Before the deployment can be performed a few secrets need to be created in the **manager server node**. [Docker secrets](https://docs.docker.com/engine/swarm/secrets/) are used as a secure alternative to serving passwords without using .env files

{% hint style="info" %}
Note: Using a strong password service such as [1Password](https://1password.com/) you should store the passwords you create in this section as you will need them regularly.
{% endhint %}

SSH into the **manager server node** and run the following commands, replacing the values with the actual secrets:

Running the following lines saves the login details to OpenHIM as Docker secrets. You will have created the OpenHIM password previously when populating database backups for your country configuration in [step 9 in section 3.2.5 Import set up files](../3.2-set-up-your-own-country-configuration/3.2.5-import-set-up-files.md). The username will likely be the default: **root@openhim.org**

```
printf "<openhim-user>" | docker secret create openhim-user -
printf "<openhim-password>" | docker secret create openhim-password -
```



### Create Docker Secrets for your communications gateway

The next steps and secrets setup the choice of communication provider and connection details to its API. &#x20;

In **production**, OpenCRVS sends automated messages at important times.  In **development** and **qa** environments, messages are not delivered.  You can edit the languages and content of all SMS messages [here](https://github.com/opencrvs/opencrvs-farajaland/blob/develop/src/features/languages/content/notification/notification.json).

| Message                          | Description                                                                                                                                                                                       |                                                                                                                                                                                                | Recipient                                      |

1\. In the country configuration directory there is an [endpoint](https://github.com/opencrvs/opencrvs-farajaland/blob/develop/src/features/notification/handler.ts) you can customise in NodeJS to change the method of communication as long as that method uses a mobile phone number with country code.  Examples are SMS, WhatsApp or USSD.

{% hint style="info" %}
If you do not want ALL of these messages to be sent, then you can stop messages by being broadcast in this handler by checking the message payload.&#x20;
{% endhint %}

{% hint style="danger" %}
You must enable a communication method for the authenticationCodeNotification message in production otherwise your staff will not be able to log in.  **REMOVING 2FA MAKES OPENCRVS INSECURE.  PROTECTING CITIZEN DATA IS NOT AN OPTION!!**  [What is two-factor authentication (2FA)?](https://authy.com/what-is-2fa/)
{% endhint %}

In our fictional country configuration package, we have configured API integrations using SMS for either [Clickatell](https://www.clickatell.com/) or [Infobip](https://www.infobip.com/).  If you wish to use them, you will need to create an account with one of these SMS providers and set up the following secrets. &#x20;

2\. SSH into the **manager server node** and run the following commands, replacing the values with the actual secrets you received from the provider:

```
# Clickatell option
printf "<clickatell-user>" | docker secret create clickatell-user -
printf "<clickatell-password>" | docker secret create clickatell-password -
printf "<clickatell-api-id>" | docker secret create clickatell-api-id -

# Infobip ooption
printf "<infobip-gateway-endpoint>" | docker secret create infobip-gateway-endpoint -
printf "<infobip-api-key>" | docker secret create infobip-api-key -
printf "<infobip-sender-id>" | docker secret create infobip-sender-id -
```

3\. After creating the secrets make sure the commands are removed from the shell history by running `history -c`

4\. In you country configuration repo, you need to set some environment variables in [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/) files so that some OpenCRVS Core microservices can access the secrets and additionally understand which languages you have configured in [step 3.2.7 Set-up language content](../3.2-set-up-your-own-country-configuration/3.2.7-set-up-language-content.md).  They need this so that they can send the correct language of SMS to the user.

``

a) In VSCode, from your country configuration repo directory, open the file **docker-compose.countryconfig.staging-deploy.yml**

Replace all instances of the following comma separated [ISO 639-1](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List\_of\_ISO\_639-1\_codes) language codes for every translation you have set up in [step 3.2.7 Set-up language content ](../3.2-set-up-your-own-country-configuration/3.2.7-set-up-language-content.md).  You will notice these provided to the **notification**, **gateway** and **workflow** microservices.

```
- LANGUAGES=en,fr
```

b) In VSCode, from your country configuration repo directory, open the file **docker-compose.countryconfig.qa-deploy.yml**

Repeat the process of replacing the languages string in this file in the same locations.

c) In VSCode, from your country configuration repo directory, open the file **docker-compose.countryconfig.prod-deploy.yml**

Repeat the process of replacing the languages string in this file in the same locations.

d) Next, in the notification microservice environment variables block, you must edit **environment** variables depending on your choice of SMS provider.  You will see this block in our Farajaland example:

```
notification:
    secrets:
      - jwt-public-key.{{ts}}
    environment:
      # some other variables
      - SMS_PROVIDER=unknown
      - LANGUAGES=en,fr
```

SMS\_PROVIDER must be set to either "**infobip**" or "**clickatell**". &#x20;

You must add a Docker secrets block and environment variable paths to access either set of Docker Secrets you set above depending on your provider. &#x20;

**So for Clickatell, the final notification service block would look like this:**

```
notification:
    secrets:
      - jwt-public-key.{{ts}}
      - clickatell-user
      - clickatell-password
      - clickatell-api-id
    environment:
      # some other variables
      - SMS_PROVIDER=clickatell
      - CLICKATELL_USER_PATH=/run/secrets/clickatell-user
      - CLICKATELL_PASSWORD_PATH=/run/secrets/clickatell-password
      - CLICKATELL_API_ID_PATH=/run/secrets/clickatell-api-id
      - LANGUAGES=en,fr
```

**For Infobip, the final notification service block would look like this:**

```
notification:
    secrets:
      - jwt-public-key.{{ts}}
      - infobip-gateway-endpoint
      - infobip-api-key
      - infobip-sender-id
    environment:
      # some other variables
      - SMS_PROVIDER=infobip
      - INFOBIP_GATEWAY_ENDPOINT_PATH=/run/secrets/infobip-gateway-endpoint
      - INFOBIP_API_KEY_PATH=/run/secrets/infobip-api-key
      - INFOBIP_SENDER_ID_PATH=/run/secrets/infobip-sender-id
      - LANGUAGES=en,fr
```

e) At the bottom of **docker-compose.countryconfig.prod-deploy.yml** you will see a block **secrets** that looks like this:

```
secrets:
  jwt-public-key.{{ts}}:
    external: true
  openhim-user:
    external: true
  openhim-password:
    external: true
```

You must add Docker Compose access to the secrets here.

**So for Clickatell the final secrets block would look like this:**

```
secrets:
  clickatell-user:
    external: true
  clickatell-password:
    external: true
  clickatell-api-id:
    external: true
  jwt-public-key.{{ts}}:
    external: true
  openhim-user:
    external: true
  openhim-password:
    external: true
```

**For Infobip the final secrets block would look like this:**

```
secrets:
  infobip-gateway-endpoint:
    external: true
  infobip-api-key:
    external: true
  infobip-sender-id:
    external: true
  jwt-public-key.{{ts}}:
    external: true
  openhim-user:
    external: true
  openhim-password:
    external: true
```



### Testing that communications are broadcast successfully

Once your OpenCRVS instance is deployed in production, you can only tell if the SMS messages successfully reached your provider by checking the Docker logs for the country configuration microservice.

SSH into the manager server and run this command to monitor the live logs for the service, looking out for any broadcast errors at the appropriate times depending on the code in the handler:

```
docker service logs -f opencrvs_countryconfig
```
