# 3.2.9 Clearing and restoring a local environment to factory reset data

Running the following 2 commands in sequence in the country configuration repo alongside a running OpenCRVS Core instance at any time, will clear out all your databases from whatever state they are in and restore from these backups.  **So these are destructive actions. Be aware.**

`yarn db:clear:all --path_to_core=`_`<your local path to the opencrvs-core directory>`_

`yarn db:backup:restore` `--path_to_core=`_`<your local path to the opencrvs-core directory>`_



It is also possible to clear and restore a server to factory defaults using similar commands.  SSH into the server and follow these [**destructive actions.  Be aware**](../3.3-set-up-a-server-hosted-environment/3.3.8-clearing-and-restoring-a-server-to-factory-reset-data.md).
